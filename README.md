# FULL STACK BAKERY PROJECT

![sitegif](site.gif)

### DESCRIPTION
This my first full-stack website. An exercise building Ruby on Sinatra. Utilizes CSS, JS, HTML, Ruby, Sinatra, and EventbriteAPI. 
For this site, I had to create a website for a client to help her bakery business. I had to highlight the products and provide information on the business.
This site was also an opportunity to employ API calls to the eventbrite website.

### DESIGN
I wanted this site to be reminiscent of a local cafe bakery.
I used "awning" tabs for the navigation bar, and bright pastel colors to create this effect.

### LANGUAGES USED
HTML, CSS, JAVSASCRIPT, SASS, RUBY, Sinatra

### RESOURCES

For this project, the following resources and frameworks were utilized in building the site:

- [Eventbrite API](https://www.eventbrite.com/): the API provided all event listings
- [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/): tool for simple site animations
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery): specialized icons!
